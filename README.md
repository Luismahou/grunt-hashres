#### grunt-hashres has been updated to Grunt 0.4. if you're still using Grunt 0.3.x go to [old version documentation](https://github.com/Luismahou/grunt-hashres/blob/master/grunt-0.3-README.md)

# grunt-hashres

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/Luismahou/grunt-hashres.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Luismahou/grunt-hashres)

Hashes your js and css files and rename the ```<script>``` and ```<link>``` declarations that refer to them in your html/php/etc files.

## Getting Started
Install this grunt plugin next to your project's [Gruntfile.js][getting_started] with: `npm install grunt-hashres`

Then add this line to your project's `grunt.js` gruntfile:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-hashres');
```

[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/
[getting_started]: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md

## Documentation
Add the following to your ```Gruntfile.js``` file, inside the ```initConfig``` function:

```js
hashres: {
  // Global options
  options: {
    // Optional. Encoding used to read/write files. Default value 'utf8'
    encoding: 'utf8',
    // Optional. Format used to name the files specified in 'files' property.
    // Default value: '${hash}.${name}.cache.${ext}'
    fileNameFormat: '${hash}.${name}.cache.${ext}',
    // Optional. Should files be renamed or only alter the references to the files
    // Use it with '${name}.${ext}?${hash} to get perfect caching without renaming your files
    // Default value: true
    renameFiles: true
  },
  // hashres is a multitask. Here 'prod' is the name of the subtask. You can have as many as you want.
  prod: {
    // Specific options, override the global ones
    options: {
      // You can override encoding, fileNameFormat or renameFiles
    },
    // Files to hash
    src: [
      // WARNING: These files will be renamed!
      'dist/prod/scripts/my-compressed-and-minified-scripts.js',
      'dist/prod/styles/my-compressed-and-minified-styles.css'],
    // File that refers to above files and needs to be updated with the hashed name
    dest: 'dist/prod/home.php',
  }
}
```

### Recommended workflow
```grunt-hashres```, as a general rule, should be run when you're going to release your code. Ideally, you should create a ```stage``` folder where you'll copy your ```html```, minified ```js``` and ```css``` and all your resources. And then, on this clean copy, hash the resource names.

### Alternative workflow
Due to popular demand, the task support to update references that where already hashed. This means, that you won't need to create a stage folder before running ```grunt-hashres```. See [#26](https://github.com/Luismahou/grunt-hashres/issues/26) and [#29](https://github.com/Luismahou/grunt-hashres/issues/29) for more info.

### Heads up
If you have upgraded from Grunt 0.3 version: 'files' and 'out' config properties have been replaced by 'src' and 'dest'

### Properties
* ```src```: A single file expression or an array of file expressions.
Something like ```myscripts/*.js``` would be valid.
* ```dest```: The file expression(s) that refer to the hashed files and that will be updated with the new names.
You can update more than one file specifying an array of output files: ```[out/fileOne.html, out/fileTwo.html]```
* ```encoding```: Encoding used to read and write files. Using ```utf8``` by default.
* ```fileNameFormat```: The files specified in property ```files``` will be renamed
according to the pattern specified in this property. The following variables are allowed:
  * ```${hash}```: the first 8 digits of the md5 of the file.
  * ```${name}```: the original name of the file.
  * ```${ext}```: the original extension of the file.
* ```renameFiles```: Rename the files or leave them in place and only alter the references to them in ```out```. Defaults to ```true```

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt][grunt].
